# ‚õ™Ô∏è n8n Sermon Automation Workflow

This repository documents the development of my **Sermon Automation Workflow** project, which uses n8n to automate various tasks for churches. These tasks include generating social media content, sermon transcripts, blog posts, etc ‚Äî helping churches extend the reach of their sermon materials with less manual effort.

## üìé Sermon Plugin Detector Workflow

This n8n workflow interacts with the **WordPress REST API** to identify which sermon plugin a church is using on their WordPress website. It starts by sending an HTTP request to the website, retrieving a list of active plugins from a [custom plugin](<https://github.com/charlottewolfe/n8n_sermon_automation_workflow/blob/main/plugin_list_plugin.php>) installed on the site.

From this list, the workflow branches into three tracks based on the detected plugin:
- **Sermon Manager**
- **Church Content**
- **Advanced Sermons**

Each branch can then be used to customize automation steps specific to that plugin's custom fields and taxonomies.

### üî® Possible Improvements
* Detecting plugins without installing a custom plugin (to make it more user-friendly for church website admins)
* Handling edge cases where a website uses multiple or none of the plugin options
* Automatically fetching custom field and taxonomy information via REST API
* Generalization to work with more websites (currently just connected to my Wordpress site)

## üìé Deepgram Audio File Transcription Workflow
This n8n workflow obtains an audio file from a given sermon uplaoded to Wordpress, and sends the file to Deepgram to be transciped. The last step of the workflow sends the transciption in an email so that it can be reviewed before continuing with the workflow.
